Redux, on the other hand, is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used to manage application state more efficiently. It is popularly used with React, a component-based UI library.
react-redux-firebase is a library that provides Redux bindings for Firebase, thereby making it easier to use Firebase with Redux and React. It also comes with some Hooks to make it easier to implement some Firebase functionality.
